# Claude Usage Companion

Android + Wear OS companion for monitoring Claude Code usage from a phone.

The phone stores the OAuth token locally, refreshes Claude usage directly, and syncs a usage snapshot to Wear OS through the Wear Data Layer. The watch never owns the OAuth token.

## Features

- Phone-first OAuth setup.
- Direct usage refresh from the phone, independent of a desktop computer.
- Cached usage snapshots with automatic refresh about once per minute when a token is saved.
- Manual refresh button for immediate updates.
- Two Material-style phone progress bars and Android widget bars:
  - 5-hour usage window.
  - 7-day usage window.
- Reset countdown labels for both windows.
- Wear OS Material 3 companion app with compact 5-hour and 7-day usage bars.
- Wear OS Tile support with a dual-ring 5-hour / 7-day glance.
- Watch settings for the Tile 7-day ring and high-usage alerts.
- Android home-screen widget.

## How Usage Is Read

The phone makes a lightweight Claude API request using the saved OAuth token and reads the Claude usage headers from the response. The app stores only the latest usage snapshot for UI, widget, and Wear sync.

The OAuth token is stored only on the phone. It is not sent to the watch.

## Run On Emulators Or Devices

Start one Android phone emulator and one Wear OS emulator, then run:

```bash
./gradlew runPhoneDebug
./gradlew runWearDebug
```

The run tasks auto-detect a phone target and a Wear target. To override the target device:

```bash
./gradlew runPhoneDebug -PphoneSerial=emulator-5554
./gradlew runWearDebug -PwearSerial=emulator-5556
```

For physical devices, connect the phone or watch with ADB debugging enabled, then run:

```bash
./gradlew runPhoneDeviceDebug
./gradlew runWearDeviceDebug
```

If more than one matching target is connected, pass the serial:

```bash
./gradlew runPhoneDeviceDebug -PphoneSerial=<phone-serial>
./gradlew runWearDeviceDebug -PwearSerial=<wear-serial>
```

You can also use the shared Android Studio run configurations:

- `Phone Emulator`
- `Wear Emulator`
- `Phone Real Device`
- `Wear Real Device`

## Build

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Project Structure

- `app/` - Android phone app and home-screen widget.
- `wear/` - Wear OS app and Tile service.
- `docs/images/` - README screenshots.

## Notes

- The app is an unofficial companion and is not affiliated with Anthropic.
- Wear Tiles currently use the legacy `androidx.wear.tiles` builders, which compile with deprecation warnings. A future cleanup can migrate the Tile implementation to ProtoLayout Material components.
- Usage availability depends on Claude's OAuth/API response headers.
